# Quantum-tic-tac-toe
###  Tic tac toe with quantum random number generator
This program works only with Qiskit and Qiskit-aer installed.

```bash 
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

After opening the program, you can choose a game mode (right now there is only single player mode available).\
After choosing the game mode, you can make your first move. The board displays numbers from 0 to 9, each corresponding to a position where you can place an X.\
After your move, a quantum random number generator selects another random position.
